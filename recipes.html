						The fermentation is complete when the pickles taste sour and the bubbles have stopped rising; this should take approximately 6 to 7 days. Once this happens, cover the crock loosely and place in the refrigerator for 3 days, skimming daily or as needed. Store for up to 2 months in the refrigerator, skimming as needed.If the pickles should become soft or begin to take on an off odor, this is a sign of spoilage and they should be discarded.

						3 pounds pickling cucumbers, 4 to 6-inches long
						1 tablespoon black peppercorns
						1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
						2 cloves garlic, crushed
						1 teaspoon dill seed
						1 large bunch dill

						In a medium saucepan, combine pickled beets, apple cider vinegar, water and brown sugar. Heat until it just comes to a boil. Place the cinnamon sticks and cloves into the jar with the eggs. Carefully pour the pickling liquid and beet slices into the jar with the eggs. Use a long, skinny spatula to ease out any remaining air bubbles. Place a lid on the jar. Once it has cooled to room temperature, refrigerate. Let pickles rest at least 48 hours before eating.
